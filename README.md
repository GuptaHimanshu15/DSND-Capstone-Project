### Communication: 
most of my findings are communicated here : https://medium.com/@himanshuuranjan/data-science-nanodegree-capstone-project-65a8a47f6d64

## Enviroment: Using jupyter notebooks,python 3

Libraries used:

1- Pandas

2- Scikit learn

3- Matplotlib , sea born,plotly

4- Sklearn

5- Pandas

## Dataset used: 

The data is contained in three files:

portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
profile.json - demographic data for each customer
transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

## Project Motivation:
As a business owner I dont want to give every customer our offers,I would like to offer only those who are liable to complete it.Because giving an offer to every person will be a waste of time and resources ,and that time and resources can be utilized in something other,so I should give offer to those who are the most trusted and valuable customers and we know that they will complete it.
My goal for this project is to know  which kind of offers, Buy One Get One Free (BOGO), Discount or informational is better to give a current customer by only knowing his/her age, gender, income and the amount they are paying and analysing them.

## Results
In this project, I tried to analyze and find out which is the best offer to give a Starbucks customer ,how is the offer being completed and who are completing more fastly. The starting point of my project is to explore the data and look after the changes I have to make in the dataset for my further analysis.I started to find out the variables in my data then I looked after my customer ages to find that which group of ages are mostly my customers so I can further look to give offers based on that.

Then I looked on the income to find that how should the price be kept for offers so that our customers do not feel its very costly according to their income. Further I did more analysis to find something relevant about the offers ,In the analysis I found that BOGO(Buy One Get One) and Discount offers were the favourite in both the genders.

Also from the visualization I got the Insight that Males were given more offer as compared to females,But there was a strange thing that despite we gave more offers to males but females were likely to complete more offers than males,as our visualization suggested.

In the period of August to January there were more profiles ,so company should be more active in giving offers for profit increase.

So In a nutshell ,the company should increment offers to females than males and also BOGO and discount are the offers which attract customers most and hence they will help the company and customer will buy more .
